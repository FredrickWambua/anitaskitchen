## Project description
Anita's kitchen landing page is form of an online menu of foods offered at the Anitas kitchen and offers during specific time. You can get personalised food offers through newsletters when you subscribe. The page is made to display variety of foods served at specific time.
## Project setup instructions
This project uses pure html5 and css. It is made to test advanced styling techniques using css. Some of the styling could be done using other languages but to simply show my understanding of advanced css styling, I opt to employ the skills.
The page is responsive to all device widths. This is taken care of using the media query in css.
In importing icons present in the project, fontawesome online files are linked on the head section of the html file.
